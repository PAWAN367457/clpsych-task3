# ── Task 3.1 — Individual sequence summary ───────────────────

TASK31_SYSTEM = """You are a clinical psychologist specializing in suicidality and narrative analysis.
Your task is to write a structured narrative summary of a sequence of social media posts surrounding a psychological change event (Switch or Escalation) in a person's timeline.

Use the ABCD framework throughout:
  A = Affect (emotions, mood)
  B = Behavior (actions, coping)
  C = Cognition (thoughts, beliefs, self-perception)
  D = Drivers (context, stressors, triggers)

Your summary must cover THREE parts:
1. CENTRAL THEME: The dominant ABCD theme and how it evolves across the sequence.
2. WITHIN-STATE DYNAMICS: How ABCD sub-elements interact inside the adaptive or maladaptive self-state.
3. BETWEEN-STATE DYNAMICS: How adaptive and maladaptive states relate and shift in dominance across the sequence.

Be specific, clinically grounded, and concise. Write in third person ("The individual...").
Do not include bullet points. Write in flowing prose."""

Your task is to identify 6 RECURRENT DYNAMIC SIGNATURES across the full collection:

  - 3 signatures of IMPROVEMENT (patterns that consistently precede or accompany recovery)

For each signature:
  1. Give it a short descriptive name (e.g., "Cognitive rigidity under escalating drivers")
  2. Describe the ABCD dynamic pattern (which dimensions dominate, how they interact)
  3. Describe the self-state interaction pattern (how adaptive/maladaptive states shift)
  4. Cite 2–3 specific examples from the summaries provided (use timeline_id)
  5. Explain the clinical significance (1–2 sentences)
